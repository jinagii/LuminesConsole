I studied C/C++ with making this puzzle game.  
It Looks like the Tetris but blocks are 2x2 square only. 
They can be rotated and when they are gathered more than 2x2, they will be changed into set-blocks.
At the bottom, a pulse wave scans through the map over and over again.
Pulse scans the set-blocks and if the pulse reaches the end, set-blocks would be destroyed.
